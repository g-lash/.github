# welcome to lash & slash!
this is a side and *very* experimental project that focuses on creating a kernel, os, and maybe **some** apps.
keep in mind that, as said earlier, this is only a "fun" project made in my free time. this project may or may not be updated at any time.

open code, endless possibilities.
